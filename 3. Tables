Netfilter Tables
1. filter
  ● filter is the default table for iptables.
  ● iptables filter table has the following built-in chains: INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD
2. nat
  ● nat table is specialized for SNAT and DNAT (Port Forwarding)
  ● iptables NAT table has the following built-in chains: PREROUTING, POSTROUTING and OUTPUT (for locally generated packets)
3. mangle
  ● iptables mangle table is specialized for packet alteration
  ● mangle table has the following built-in chains: PREROUTING, INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING
4. raw 
  ● The raw table is only used to set a mark on packets that should not be handled by the 
    connection tracking system. This is done by using the NOTRACK target on the packet.
  ● raw table has the following built-in chains: PREROUTING and OUTPUT



In a nutshell
  ● Incoming traffic is filtered on the INPUT CHAIN of the filter table
  ● Outgoing traffic is filtered on the OUTPUT CHAIN of the filter table
  ● Routed traffic is filtered on the FORWARD CHAIN of the filter table
  ● SNAT/MASQUERADE is done on the POSTROUTING CHAIN of the nat table
  ● DNAT/PortForwarding is done on the PREROUTING CHAIN of the nat table
  ● To modify values from the packet headers we add rules to the mangle table
  ● To skip connection tracking we add rules with NOTRACK target to the raw table
